Ant script to automatically publish a chrome extension from within eclipse, generate an updates.xml, and exclude private project files from being added to the final .crx file.

Before using, configure the script by changing properties that contain "##EDIT##". Careful not to remove all of the "##EDIT##" strings, some are used for configuration validation.
